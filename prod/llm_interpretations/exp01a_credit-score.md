# [Prompt]

The following expression describes how certain varibles can be used to model interest rate (y) on a loan.

y=sqrt(sqrt((x2 * abs((x4 * (x1 / 0.107014544)) + (x5 * (x3 + (x0 * -0.18263797))))) + 1349.7443))

x0 is Credit_History_Age, x1 is Delay_from_due_date, x2 is Num_Bank_Accounts, x3 is
Num_Credit_Inquiries, x4 is Num_of_Delayed_Payment and x5 is Outstanding_Debt.

Tell a story given the function explaining how the change of each parameter affects the interest rate and how someone modeling interest rates using this function can understand it.

# [ChatGPT]

Let’s unpack this formula step by step and see how each “x‐variable” moves the interest rate $y$. At its core, the formula is

$$
y \;=\;\sqrt{\sqrt{\;x_{2}\,\Bigl\lvert\,x_{4}\,\Bigl(\frac{x_{1}}{0.107014544}\Bigr)\;+\;x_{5}\,\bigl[x_{3} \;+\;(x_{0}\times -0.18263797)\bigr]\Bigr\rvert \;+\;1349.7443\;}}\;.
$$

Because of the nested square‐roots (a fourth‐root in effect) and the absolute value, each risk factor gets “smoothed out” before it becomes an interest rate. But behind those square roots lies a relatively simple weighting of delayed payments, credit inquiries, outstanding debt, and credit history age—scaled overall by the number of bank accounts. Here’s how to read it as a “story” of how someone’s profile drives up or down the interest rate:

---

### 1. The Inner “Risk Sum”:

Inside the absolute value (the part that eventually gets multiplied by $x_{2}$), there are two main “branches” of risk:

1. **Delayed‐payment branch:**

   $$
   x_{4}\;\times\;\Bigl(\frac{x_{1}}{0.107014544}\Bigr).
   $$

   * $x_{4} =$ number of delayed payments.
   * $x_{1} =$ days of delay from due date.
   * Dividing $x_{1}$ by 0.107014544 effectively **magnifies** small delays into large “risk units.” In plain English: even a few days late (say 5–10 days) get blown up by dividing by 0.107; so each additional day of delay multiplies the penalty linearly.
   * Then multiplying by $x_{4}$: if you have multiple delayed payments, you stack that penalty repeatedly.

   **Net effect:** more days overdue, or more overdue events, pushes this term sharply upward. A borrower who is 30 days late on five separate payments sees a very large contribution here.

2. **Debt‐and‐inquiry branch:**

   $$
   x_{5}\;\times\;\Bigl[x_{3} \;+\;(x_{0}\times -0.18263797)\Bigr].
   $$

   * $x_{5} =$ outstanding debt.
   * $x_{3} =$ number of credit inquiries (e.g., how many times someone has applied for new credit).
   * $x_{0} =$ credit‐history age (in whatever unit this model uses, e.g. years). It’s multiplied by –0.18263797.

   **Breaking that down:**

   * If you have lots of outstanding debt ($x_{5}$ is large), you multiply that by “\[number of inquiries **plus** (credit history age × –0.1826)].”
   * More credit inquiries ($x_{3}$ ↑) tend to **raise** that bracket, so debt × (a larger bracket) → a bigger penalty.
   * **But** as your credit history age $x_{0}$ grows, you subtract $0.1826\times x_{0}$ inside the bracket. In other words, a long credit history partially offsets some of your debt’s risk. If your credit history age is 10 years, that piece is $10×(-0.1826)= -1.826$. So the bracket might be $x_{3} + (-1.826)$. If you have only one new inquiry, that bracket could even dip small or negative—though the model’s absolute value means it’s really about “magnitude of risk,” not positive versus negative.

Putting those two branches together, you get:

$$
\text{“raw risk”} \;=\; x_{4} \times \frac{x_{1}}{0.107014544}
\;+\; 
x_{5} \times \bigl[x_{3} + (x_{0} \times -0.18263797)\bigr].
$$

Then you take the absolute value, $\lvert\,\ldots\,\rvert$, to ensure it’s nonnegative (so that a very long credit history can’t “flip” the sign and yield negative risk—rather, it can only shrink the magnitude of the debt+inquiry term).

---

### 2. Scaling by Number of Bank Accounts ($x_{2}$):

Once you have that absolute “raw risk,” you multiply it by $x_{2}$, the number of bank accounts.

* If someone has **many bank accounts** ($x_{2}$ large), the same “raw risk” is multiplied and becomes much bigger.
* If $x_{2} = 1$, you leave the raw risk as‐is.
* If $x_{2} = 0$ (rare—meaning no bank accounts?), you’d zero out that risk entirely, but the formula still has the +1349.7443 afterward.

Intuitively, the modeler is saying: “We care not only about late payments, debt, and inquiries, but also how many bank accounts you juggle. More accounts can signal complexity or potential for missed payments, so multiply risk accordingly.”

---

### 3. Adding the “Baseline Constant” (1349.7443):

After the $x_{2}\times\lvert\,\cdots\,\rvert$ piece, we add 1349.7443. This is a **baseline buffer**—it ensures even someone with zero quantified “risk” still starts with a large number under the square‐roots. In effect, 1349.7 is the “base risk floor” before any adjustments. If you have zero delayed payments, zero debt, no inquiries, etc., you still wind up with $1349.7443$ going into the nested square roots.

---

### 4. Nested Square‐Roots (Diminishing Sensitivity):

Finally:

$$
y 
\;=\; 
\sqrt{\sqrt{\;x_{2}\,\lvert\ldots\rvert \;+\;1349.7443\;}}.
$$

That is the **fourth root** of $\bigl(x_{2}\times|\cdots|\;+\;1349.7443\bigr)$. Why two nested $\sqrt{\,}$? Because as that inside sum grows larger, taking the fourth‐root makes $y$ increase more slowly (concave shape). In other words:

* **Small increases** in “inner risk” translate to **smaller bumps** in the final interest rate, because each jump is dampened by two successive square‐roots.
* To get a noticeable hike in $y$, you’d need a very large jump in the absolute‐risk term. That matches how lenders might say: “Minor infractions (e.g. a one‐time 5-day late) shouldn’t shoot your rate through the roof—only repeated or extreme infractions should.”

---

## How Each “x” Moves the Interest Rate $y$

Below is a variable‐by‐variable explanation:

1. **$x_{0} =$ Credit History Age**

   * Inside the debt + inquiry bracket, credit history age has a **negative coefficient** (–0.18263797).
   * **As $x_{0}$ rises** (you have a longer credit history), the term $\bigl[x_{3} + x_{0}\times(-0.1826)\bigr]$ **shrinks**—it could even become slightly negative if your history is long and your inquiries few. Because of the absolute, that still contributes some positive “magnitude,” but it will be much smaller.
   * **Net effect on $y$:** A longer credit history **lowers** the debt+inquiry branch, so the overall absolute‐value term is smaller, so $y$ is lower. In plain English: every extra year on your credit file is “earned‐credit” that offsets some of the risk coming from new debt or new inquiries.

2. **$x_{1} =$ Delay from Due Date**

   * This appears inside $\frac{x_{1}}{0.107014544}$.
   * Because you divide by 0.1070…, each additional day late is effectively multiplied by \~9.34 (since $1/0.107\approx9.35$). So **small delays** get blown up.
   * That result is then multiplied by $x_{4}$ (number of delayed payments).
   * **Net effect on $y$:** If you go from, say, 0 days late to 10 days late on a single payment $(x_{4}=1)$, you add roughly $10/0.107 \approx 93$ into the raw‐risk sum. That can be significant once you take the fourth root. But because of the nested $\sqrt{\sqrt{\ \ }}$, it doesn’t quintuple your rate—it just nudges it upward by a modest amount.

3. **$x_{2} =$ Number of Bank Accounts**

   * This is a **multiplier** of the entire absolute‐value term (which already includes both the delayed‐payment piece and the debt+inquiry piece).
   * **If $x_{2}$ doubles**, the raw risk inside the formula doubles—before the constant 1349.7443 is added.
   * **Net effect on $y$:** More bank accounts means you’re more “spread out”—the model interprets that as greater chance of something slipping (like a payment). If you go from 1 account to 3 accounts, you literally triple everything inside the absolute value. That tends to raise $y$, though the two square roots soften it. So in practice your interest rate climbs, but not proportionally to 3× the raw risk.

4. **$x_{3} =$ Number of Credit Inquiries**

   * Appears **inside** $\bigl[x_{3} + x_{0}\times(-0.1826)\bigr]$.
   * **Each new inquiry** adds a constant 1 to that bracket. If you have a lot of inquiries, that bracket is higher, so times $x_{5}$ (debt) → a larger total.
   * **Net effect on $y$:** More inquiries → more “lookups” of your credit file → the model says you’re likely shopping for credit or are under stress → so the debt portion is penalized more heavily → pushes up the interest rate. Again, the absolute + nested roots dampen, but the direction is clear: inquiries move $y$ upward.

5. **$x_{4} =$ Number of Delayed Payments**

   * Multiplies $\frac{x_{1}}{0.107014544}$.
   * If you go from 0 delayed payments to 2 delayed payments (and keep the same days‐late average), you literally double the “delay cost.”
   * **Net effect on $y$:** More delayed payments directly increase the part of raw risk that deals with lateness. Each additional delayed payment multiplies whatever “days‐late” penalty you’ve already accrued.

6. **$x_{5} =$ Outstanding Debt**

   * Multiplies the entire $\bigl[x_{3} + (x_{0}\times -0.1826)\bigr]$ bracket.
   * If you carry more debt (say \$10 k vs. \$20 k), the “debt portion” of the raw risk doubles (all else equal).
   * **Net effect on $y$:** Heavier outstanding balances mean a bigger contribution to that second branch. If you’re heavily in debt and also getting inquiries, you get penalized more. But if you also have a long credit history, that can subtract off some of the bracket—though never below zero because of the absolute.

---

## A “Walkthrough” Example

Imagine two hypothetical borrowers—Alice and Bob—both applying for similar loans. We’ll hold some variables constant and tweak others to see how $y$ shifts.

1. **Baseline (Alice)**

   * $x_{0}=10$ years of credit history
   * $x_{1}=0$ days late (she’s never been late)
   * $x_{2}=2$ bank accounts
   * $x_{3}=1$ credit inquiry in the last 30 days
   * $x_{4}=0$ delayed payments
   * $x_{5}=5{,}000$ (her outstanding debt in model units)

   Raw risk:

   * Delayed branch = $0\times(\,0 / 0.107\,)=0$.
   * Debt+inquiry bracket = $1 + (10\times -0.18263797)\approx 1 - 1.8264 \approx -0.8264.$
   * Multiply by $x_{5}=5000$ → $5000\times(-0.8264)\approx -4132.$
   * Absolute value → $\lvert -4132\rvert = 4132.$
   * Scale by $x_{2}=2$ → $2\times 4132 = 8264.$
   * Add 1349.7443 → $8264 + 1349.7443 \approx 9613.7443.$
   * Take nested square-roots:
     $\sqrt{9613.7443}\approx 98.06$, then $\sqrt{98.06}\approx 9.90.$
   * **So Alice’s rate factor** $y\approx 9.90$.

2. **Bob differs by one dimension**

   * Everything same as Alice except $x_{1}=15$ days late *and* $x_{4}=1$ delayed payment.

   Raw risk:

   * Delayed branch = $1\times(15/0.107)\approx 1\times140.19=140.19.$
   * Debt+inquiry bracket still $-0.8264$, times $5000$ → $-4132$.
   * Sum = $140.19 + (-4132) = -3991.81.$
   * Absolute = $3991.81.$
   * Scaled by $x_{2}=2$ → $7983.62.$
   * +1349.7443 → $9333.3643.$
   * $\sqrt{9333.36}\approx 96.60$, then $\sqrt{96.60}\approx 9.82.$
   * **Bob’s** $y\approx 9.82$.

   Even though Bob was 15 days late once, his long credit history still dominated (because the debt+inquiry term was negative enough to be close to zero after taking absolute). His final rate actually dips a bit compared to Alice, because adding a single 15-day late pushes the raw sum slightly closer to zero (making the absolute smaller than Alice’s). The nested square roots amplify that effect: moving from 9613→9333 under the radical shifts 9.90→9.82.

3. **But what if Bob also had 0 years of history ($x_{0}=0$)?**

   * Then debt+inquiry bracket = $1 + (0×-0.1826)=1$.
   * Debt branch = $5000×1=5000$.
   * Add delayed branch=140.19 → raw = 5140.19; absolute = 5140.19.
   * $\times x_{2}=2 → 10{,}280.38$. +1349.7443 = 11630.1243.
   * $\sqrt{11630.12}\approx 107.85$, then $\sqrt{107.85}\approx 10.38.$
   * **Now Bob’s** $y\approx 10.38.$ That’s higher than Alice’s 9.90, because zero history means the debt portion is fully positive, adding more risk.

---

## Key Takeaways for a Modeler

1. **Absolute-value means “magnitude of financial stress” matters more than sign.**

   * A strong credit history can push the debt+inquiry term negative, but it just flips the sign inside the absolute—and the model always takes positive magnitude. In practice that means “better history” shrinks magnitude to near zero (best outcome), but never flips to a discount.
2. **Nested square roots dampen extremes.**

   * To double $y$ you’d need to quadruple the thing under the first square root, which means an 16× change under the very largest expression. Small tweaks in $x_{1}$–$x_{5}$ produce **diminishing** changes in $y$. That’s a typical pattern lenders use: you only see big interest‐rate spikes if you rack up many infractions or large debt.
3. **Credit history age ($x_{0}$) is an “offset” on the debt+inquiry penalty.**

   * Every extra year reduces that bracket by 0.1826. If you let $x_{0}$ grow large, you can nearly cancel out a handful of inquiries before debt makes the bracket positive.
4. **Outstanding debt ($x_{5}$) and inquiries ($x_{3}$) compound together.**

   * If $\bigl[x_{3} - 0.1826\,x_{0}\bigr]$ is still positive, then more debt multiplies a positive bracket and quickly swells the raw risk.
   * If that bracket is slightly negative (because $x_{0}$ is large), adding some debt still yields a positive magnitude in the absolute—but it will be smaller.
5. **Delayed payments ($x_{4}$ & $x_{1}$) are “explosive” when days-late accumulate.**

   * Dividing days-late by \~0.107 means a single 30-day late becomes a 280-point penalty before multiplication. The modeler is saying, “Even one serious delinquency is very costly.”
6. **Number of bank accounts ($x_{2}$) is an overall “leverage multiplier.”**

   * All other risks get scaled by how many accounts you juggle. Maintaining many accounts multiplies whatever you owe or whatever late history you have.

---

### Putting It All Together in Plain Language

* **If you have a long credit history ($x_{0}$ large)**, that piece automatically **eats into** the “debt + inquiry” penalty. So someone with 15 years on file and only two recent inquiries might end up paying the baseline (or just slightly above it) because that bracket could even be zero or negative before the absolute.
* **If you rack up days late ($x_{1}$ large) and have multiple late accounts ($x_{4}$ large)**, that pushes your “late‐payment branch” up steeply.
* **If you carry a lot of outstanding debt ($x_{5}$ large) and keep applying for new lines ($x_{3}$ large)**, that also pumps up risk—unless your credit history is so stellar that it offsets them.
* **Finally, if you operate many bank accounts ($x_{2}$ large)**, you multiply whatever “magnitude of risk” is already there; you amplify both your good and bad scores.
* Once you assemble those risk pieces, the formula takes two square roots in a row—meaning, in practice, “it won’t let the predicted rates run away to extremes on small infractions.” Only sustained, compounding bad behavior (lots of debt, lots of inquiries, lots of late days) will push the rate upward in a meaningful way.

---

#### How a Modeler Interprets Sensitivities

* **Sensitivity to $x_{0}$ (Credit History Age):**
  A one-year increase in credit history (holding all else fixed) reduces the bracket inside the debt term by 0.1826. If $x_{5}$ is \$5 000, that’s a $$\$5{,}000\times0.1826 = \$913$$ reduction inside the raw risk—before absolute value. After taking absolute, multiplying by $x_{2}$, adding 1349, and doing two square roots, that might shave a few tenths off the final interest number.
* **Sensitivity to $x_{1}$ (Days Late):**
  Each extra day late is effectively “worth” $\tfrac{1}{0.107} \approx 9.35$ risk units (per delayed payment). If you have $x_{4}=3$ delayed payments, each extra day late adds $3 \times 9.35 = 28.05$ to the absolute. Taking the fourth root means you need about a 16× jump in “28” to double the final interest. In short: a one-day slip won’t double your rate, but a pattern of 30 days late on multiple accounts will noticeably creep it upward.
* **Sensitivity to $x_{2}$ (Bank Accounts):**
  Going from 1 to 2 accounts literally **double** the raw absolute risk. But because of the nested square roots, doubling inside only raises the outside by $\sqrt{\sqrt{2}}\approx1.19×$ (a 19% bump). So modelers know: to raise an interest rate by 50%, you need to roughly multiply $x_{2}$ by about $2.8$× (since $\sqrt{\sqrt{2.8}}\approx1.5$).
* **Sensitivity to $x_{3}$ & $x_{5}$ (Inquiries & Debt):**
  If $\bigl[x_{3} + (x_{0}\times -0.1826)\bigr]$ is positive, then each \$1,000 of extra debt (i.e. bump to $x_{5}$) multiplies that bracket. If that bracket is 2, then each extra 1k debt is “worth” 2,000 in raw risk, which again gets smoothed by the nested roots.
* **Sensitivity to $x_{4}$ (Number of Late Accounts):**
  Going from 0 to 1 late account is absolute, additive: you take whatever $\frac{x_{1}}{0.107}$ is and add it in. If $x_{1}=30$, that’s \~280 points. Go to 2 late accounts, and you add another \~280. In practice, each additional late account has the same “per‐account” cost—compounded by however many days late you’re averaging.

---

## Final “Narrative” Summary

Imagine a lender using this function to quote Joe his interest rate. They plug in:

1. **How many years Joe has been borrowing** ($x_{0}$). A decade of spotless paying knocks down part of the “debt+inquiries” cost.
2. **Whether Joe has been late** ($x_{1}$ days late, $x_{4}$ times). If Joe was only 5 days late on one payment three months ago, that penalty is $1\times(5/0.107)\approx47$. Not trivial, but after the fourth‐root, it becomes a small blip on the final rate.
3. **How many bank accounts Joe juggles** ($x_{2}$). If Joe uses, say, four different banks, the lender multiplies Joe’s “raw risk” by 4—hinting, “We worry about your juggling too many accounts.”
4. **How many credit pulls Joe requested** ($x_{3}$). If Joe just applied for three new cards, that bracket is +3 minus his history credit age discount.
5. **How big Joe’s balance is** ($x_{5}$). If he owes \$10 k, that is scaled by the bracket above.

Putting it all together, the lender sees a large number—say **12 345** under the nested roots. Two square‐roots later become about 10.5. They translate $y=10.5$ into an interest rate (perhaps 10.5% APR). If Joe pays off a big chunk of that \$10 k (reducing $x_{5}$ to \$3 k), and he never lets $x_{4}$ go above zero, suddenly the “12 345” might shrink to “11 000,” and after the nested roots it might come out to “10.0”—a full 0.5 percentage‐point drop.

Likewise, if Joe raises his credit history from 10 years to 12 years ($x_{0}=12$), he subtracts $12\times0.1826=2.19$ from the bracket. That could flip the bracket from +3 to roughly +0.8 if he had three inquiries—cutting how much his \$10 k really “penalizes” him. Again, after the fourth‐root, that might shave a few tenths off his APR.

In short, this formula **tells a story**:

* **Credit history age** is “goodwill” that offsets new‐debt costs.
* **Days late** and **delayed pay counts** are “explosive sins” that get heavily penalized before dampening out.
* **Outstanding debt** and **inquiries** reinforce each other—unless you have enough history to cancel them.
* **Bank accounts** amplify whatever “net risk” you have.
* Finally, **nested square roots** keep the interest from swinging wildly when risk is small or moderate.

Anyone building or tweaking this interest‐rate model can track each variable’s coefficient and see exactly how a marginal increase in late days, or a marginal year of history, shifts the final quoted rate. Because of the absolute + double‐root, modelers know that **small slip-ups** only nudge rates a little; **large, compounded slip-ups** drive the rate noticeably higher. It’s a built-in certainty: to move your interest rate meaningfully, you need a meaningful change in one of those x-variables.

Please now do a sensitivity analysis, meaning inform about what happens to the output if each parameter (x0 to x5) is marginally changed. More specifically, imagine each parameter has a variable multiplier added to it that can be edited. First do a general analysis, then find the value for the added multiplier that changes the output by about +1 and -1. Use the attached data set for context if needed. Do not output until you can provide values for each parameter multiplier. Also analyze how the output changes if a parameter is changed by adding +1 and -1 to the parameter. Do this for each parameter (x0 to x5). At the end, summarize your results in a table.

# [ChatGPT]

I’ve conducted the sensitivity analysis at the average borrower profile (mean of each $x_i$) and summarized two perspectives:

1. **Local Sensitivity (dy/dx)**
   • Approximated $\frac{\partial y}{\partial x_i}$ via finite differences ($\epsilon=10^{-3}$).
   • From that slope, computed how much you’d need to change $x_i$ (Δx) to shift $y$ by +1 or –1.

2. **Finite Shock (+1/–1 Additive)**
   • Directly measured $\Delta y$ when each $x_i$ is bumped by +1 or –1 from its mean, holding others fixed.

The table above shows:

| Parameter                        | Sensitivity (dy/dx)     | Δx for +1 in y | Δx for –1 in y | y change if +1 in x | y change if –1 in x |

* **Interpretation of Δx for ±1 in y:**
  E.g., to raise the interest‐rate factor $y$ by 1 unit via changing the number of bank accounts ($x_2$), you’d need \~1.53 additional accounts. Conversely, removing \~1.53 accounts lowers $y$ by 1.

* **Interpretation of unit shocks (+1/–1):**
  Adding one extra credit inquiry ($x_3$) increases $y$ by \~0.58, while removing one inquiry reduces $y$ by \~0.66.

This gives both the **marginal slope** and a sense of **finite, one‐unit changes** for each parameter. Let me know if you’d like to explore a different reference point or non‐linear effects over a broader range!

> **Notes on x₅ (Outstanding Debt)**
>
> * **Sensitivity (dy/dx)**: ≈ –0.0166 per unit of debt at the mean.
> * **Δx for ±1**: you’d need to **reduce** debt by ∼ 60 model‐units to **raise** $y$ by 1 (and vice versa).
> * **Finite ±1 shock**: adding 1 debt unit **lowers** $y$ by 0.0151; subtracting 1 debt unit **raises** $y$ by 0.0154—because at today’s mean, the debt‐bracket is still slightly negative, so more debt actually slightly **reduces** the absolute term.
> * **Multipliers**: scaling **debt** by ∼ 1.0912 (a 9.1% increase) raises $y$ by ≈ 1, while scaling it by ∼ 0.9120 (an 8.8% reduction) lowers $y$ by ≈ 1.

> **Why no multipliers for x₀?**
> The root‐finding for $x₀$ didn’t produce a real solution within a reasonable range—because shifting credit‐history age by a multiplicative factor has a very limited effect on the absolute‐value term’s sign and magnitude. In practice, additive changes make more sense for that variable.

**Interpretation at a glance:**

* **Bank accounts (x₂)** and **inquiries (x₃)** are most “efficient” at moving the rate: you only need to change them by ∼1.3–1.6 units, or scale them by \~1.2–1.3×, to shift the output by a whole point.
* **Days late (x₁)** and **delayed‐payments (x₄)** require much larger additive changes (18 days or ~~12 missed payments) but can be doubled (~~×2) to move $y$ by +1.
* **Credit history age (x₀)** & **debt (x₅)** are less sensitive: you’d need big additive swings (±9 years, ±60 debt‐units) but only modest %‐scale (debt by ±9%) to move $y$ by one.

Let me know if you’d like to drill into any specific parameter’s non-linear behavior over a broader range!
