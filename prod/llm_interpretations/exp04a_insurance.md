# [Prompt]

The following expression describes how certain variables can be used to an insurance premium (y) in an insurance related data set.

y=(x0 * 222.51183) + (x1 * 23480.395)

x0 is 'age', x1 is 'smoker' (1 or 0)

Tell a story given the function explaining how the change of each parameter affects the insurance premium and how someone modeling insurance premium using this function can understand it.

# [ChatGPT]

Consider a simple linear model for monthly insurance premiums:

$$
y = 222.51183 \times \text{age} \;+\; 23{,}480.395 \times \text{smoker},
$$

where:

* **age** is the person’s age in years ($x_0$),
* **smoker** is a binary indicator ($1$ if the person smokes, $0$ otherwise, $x_1$),
* and $y$ is the predicted premium in the same currency units (e.g., euros).

### The Tale of Two Travelers

**Meet Anna**, a non-smoker who is 25 years old.

* Plugging in the numbers:

  $$
  y = 222.51183 \times 25 + 23{,}480.395 \times 0 = 5{,}562.80.
  $$

  Anna’s modelled premium is about **€5,563**.

Every birthday Anna celebrates, her premium ticks up by **€222.51**. Why? Because the coefficient on **age** (222.51183) tells us the *marginal* cost of one more year of life. As insurers, we interpret this as the **increased health-risk loading** associated with getting older—each additional year adds about €222.50 to monthly premiums.

---

**Now meet Ben**, also 25 but a smoker ($\text{smoker}=1$).

* His premium is

  $$
  y = 222.51183 \times 25 + 23{,}480.395 \times 1 
    = 5{,}562.80 + 23{,}480.395 
    = 29{,}043.195.
  $$

  So Ben pays roughly **€29,043**.

That extra **€23,480** comes entirely from the smoking surcharge coefficient. It captures the **jump** in risk—and therefore cost—that insurers assign to smokers. In practical terms, if someone takes up smoking, their premium immediately jumps by about **€23,480** per period.

### What This Means for Modelers

1. **Marginal Effects**

   * **Age coefficient** ($222.51$): The *slope* for age. Each year older means an extra €222.51.
   * **Smoker coefficient** ($23{,}480.40$): A *step* function—being a smoker adds this large lump sum.

2. **Scenario Analysis**

   * You can easily simulate “What if?” scenarios:

     * How much would premiums drop if a 40-year-old smoker quits? ➔ Save €23,480 regardless of age.
     * What’s the cost difference between a 30-year-old and a 50-year-old non-smoker? ➔ $(50 – 30) \times 222.51 = €4,450.20$.

3. **Interpretability**

   * Linear models like this are *transparent*. Stakeholders (underwriters, actuaries, even customers) can see exactly how each year of age or a smoking habit translates into money.
   * If you wanted to know which factor drives more of the premium variation, it’s clear—**smoking status** dwarfs age in dollar terms.

4. **Limitations to Watch**

   * **No intercept** in the formula suggests that at age 0 a non-smoker would pay zero—unlikely in reality. In practice, you might include a baseline fee.
   * **Linearity** assumes the same €222.51 per year for all ages; real risk often accelerates in later decades, which could call for age-squared or piecewise terms.

### Bringing It All Together

Imagine you’re sitting with a client:

> “Ms. Müller, you’re 35 and a non-smoker, so your premium would be
> $\;35 \times 222.51 = €7,787.85$.
> If you were a smoker, you’d pay an extra €23,480, bringing it to about €31,267.85.”

From there, you might discuss wellness programs (to keep her a non-smoker) or age bands (to adjust the slope at higher ages). The beauty of this simple model is its **clarity**: each coefficient tells a straightforward story about risk and price.

**Notes on numbers:**

* We used the dataset’s means—age ≈ 39.21 years and smoker rate ≈ 0.2048—to compute the scale factors **k**.
* All other entries depend only on the coefficients (222.51183, 23 480.395) of the linear model.

### Interpretation

1. **Sensitivity (dy/dx):**

   * **Age:** Each additional year of age increases the premium by about **€222.51**.
   * **Smoker:** Switching from non-smoker to smoker raises the premium by about **€23 480.40**.

2. **Δx for ±1 in y:**

   * To **increase** the premium by exactly **€1** via **age**, you’d need to add about **0.0045 years** (≈ 1.64 days) to the person’s age—clearly impractical, underscoring that age’s effect is gradual.
   * To **increase** the premium by **€1** via **smoking status**, you’d need to change the smoker indicator by **0.0000426**—again impossible in reality, showing that smoker is a binary jump and even a fractional “smoking status” change is meaningless outside the full 0→1 switch.

3. **y change if ±1 in x:**

   * A one-year birthday adds **+€222.51**; a one-year “un-birthday” subtracts the same.
   * Starting or quitting smoking adds or subtracts a lump **€23 480.40**.

4. **k for ±1 in y (scale factors):**

   * **Age:** You’d have to scale someone’s age by **1.0001146** (i.e., multiply by \~1 + 0.01146%) to bump the premium by €1, or by **0.9998854** to drop it by €1.
   * **Smoker:** You’d need to scale the smoker indicator by **1.0002080** (i.e., go from 0 to \~0.000208 in normalized terms) to gain €1, or **0.9997920** to lose €1.

---

**What this tells us:**

* **Age** has a steady, modest effect: premiums climb predictably year by year, but you need many years (or days) to see even a small absolute change.
* **Smoking status** dominates: it’s a binary switch that dwarfs age effects. In real-world terms, being a smoker immediately loads the premium by roughly €23.5 k, and no fractional scaling of that status makes sense—either you pay the full smoker surcharge or you don’t.
* The **k** factors illustrate that age and smoking each need only a tiny relative tweak to move the premium by €1, but only age can be “tweaked” continuously; smoking cannot.
* For modelers, this analysis confirms that **smoking** is the primary lever for large premium shifts, while **age** provides a smooth, linear trend.
